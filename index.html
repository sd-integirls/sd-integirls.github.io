                            Of course, you should really attend this competition. In the past, many people have stated that INTEGIRLS gave them an entry into math competitions and they had no idea how it was until they attended the event. If you would like any pointers to understand how to prepare, you can feel free to email us. Hope to see you at our event(s).
